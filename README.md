### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notice for Waves Users:

If you have a large Waves plugin collection (e.g., Waves Ultimate or similar bundles), the initial plugin scan process can take significant time.  
This is normal! Do not close the application during scanning.  

**Estimated Scan Time:**  
- Small plugin set: a few seconds to 2 minutes  
- Large plugin set (Waves Ultimate): Up to 10-15 minutes  

‚úÖ The scan only happens once. After completion, idolLiveAudio saves the results to a local file for faster future startups.

### üéß Recommended Audio Setup

idolLiveAudio is designed for real-time audio processing. For the best experience, a dedicated external sound card with low-latency ASIO drivers is highly recommended.  

**If you don't have a professional sound card, we strongly suggest installing these free tools:**  
- [VB-Cable](https://vb-audio.com/Cable/) ‚Äì Virtual audio cable  
- [ASIO4ALL](https://www.asio4all.org/) ‚Äì Universal ASIO driver for low-latency audio  
- [Voicemeeter Banana](https://vb-audio.com/Voicemeeter/banana.htm) ‚Äì Virtual mixer and routing software  

These tools help you achieve stable, low-latency audio processing even on regular computers without expensive hardware.

## üîä Soundboard & Hotkey System

idolLiveAudio includes a Soundboard feature, allowing you to trigger sound effects or music clips quickly during your live sessions.  

**Current Limitations:**  
- Hotkeys for triggering soundboard actions only work while the idolLiveAudio window is focused (active).  

**Why no Global Hotkey yet?**  
- Global Hotkey support requires system-wide key capture, which many antivirus tools flag as suspicious behavior in unsigned software.  
- To protect idolLiveAudio's reputation and ensure user safety, Global Hotkey functionality will be added in future releases after we obtain a verified code signing certificate.
