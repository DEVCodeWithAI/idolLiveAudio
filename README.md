## ‚ú® What's New in v1.1.0: Full Mini-DAW Functionality

Version 1.1.0 transforms idolLiveAudio from a simple plugin host into a powerful Mini-DAW with a complete recording and playback workflow.

### 1. Dedicated FX Chains

Each track (Vocal and Music) now has 4 dedicated FX Send channels. This allows you to use effects like reverb and delay in parallel, just like in a professional DAW, giving you more control over your sound without cluttering your main plugin chain.

### 2. Per-Track Player & Recorder

Every track now features its own integrated Player and Recorder:

- **Load**: Load any audio file (like a backing track or instrumental) directly into a track to have it processed by that track's plugins.
- **Record (Post-FX)**: Record the output of a single track after all its plugins and FX have been applied. This is perfect for quickly capturing a processed vocal take or an idea.

### 3. Multi-Track Project System

This is the biggest new feature, enabling a full production workflow:

- **Record Project (RAW)**: Simultaneously record the RAW, unprocessed input from both the Vocal and Music tracks. This captures your performance in its purest form, perfect for mixing and mastering later.
- **Manage Projects**: All your recorded projects are saved neatly. The Project Manager lets you view, load, or delete them.
- **Synchronized Playback**: Load a project, and both RAW tracks will play back in perfect sync. The seek bars are linked, allowing you to navigate your project as a single piece.

- Export to your preferred IDE (Visual Studio, Xcode, etc.)  
- Build and run  

**Option 2: Download Prebuilt Release**  
- Check the [Releases](https://github.com/DEVCodeWithAI/idolLiveAudio/releases) section for v1.1.0  
- Download the latest `.zip` package  
- Extract and run the application

## üé¨ Usage Instructions

- A full tutorial video will be provided soon.  
- Please visit the [Releases](https://github.com/DEVCodeWithAI/idolLiveAudio/releases) page to download the latest version.  
- Extract the `.zip` file and launch idolLiveAudio.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notice for Waves Users:

If you have a large Waves plugin collection (e.g., Waves Ultimate or similar bundles), the initial plugin scan process can take significant time.  
This is normal! Do not close the application during scanning.  

**Estimated Scan Time:**  
- Small plugin set: a few seconds to 2 minutes  
- Large plugin set (Waves Ultimate): Up to 10-15 minutes  

‚úÖ The scan only happens once. After completion, idolLiveAudio saves the results to a local file for faster future startups.

### üéß Recommended Audio Setup

idolLiveAudio is designed for real-time audio processing. For the best experience, a dedicated external sound card with low-latency ASIO drivers is highly recommended.  

**If you don't have a professional sound card, we strongly suggest installing these free tools:**  
- [VB-Cable](https://vb-audio.com/Cable/) ‚Äì Virtual audio cable  
- [ASIO4ALL](https://www.asio4all.org/) ‚Äì Universal ASIO driver for low-latency audio  
- [Voicemeeter Banana](https://vb-audio.com/Voicemeeter/banana.htm) ‚Äì Virtual mixer and routing software  

These tools help you achieve stable, low-latency audio processing even on regular computers without expensive hardware.

## üîä Soundboard & Hotkey System

idolLiveAudio includes a Soundboard feature, allowing you to trigger sound effects or music clips quickly during your live sessions.  

**Current Limitations:**  
- Hotkeys for triggering soundboard actions only work while the idolLiveAudio window is focused (active).  

**Why no Global Hotkey yet?**  
- Global Hotkey support requires system-wide key capture, which many antivirus tools flag as suspicious behavior in unsigned software.  
- To protect idolLiveAudio's reputation and ensure user safety, Global Hotkey functionality will be added in future releases after we obtain a verified code signing certificate.
