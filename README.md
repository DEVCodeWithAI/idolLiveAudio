## ‚ú® What's New in v1.1.0: Full Mini-DAW Functionality

Version 1.1.0 transforms idolLiveAudio from a simple plugin host into a powerful Mini-DAW with a complete recording and playback workflow.

* **Dedicated FX Chains**: Each track (Vocal and Music) now has 4 dedicated FX Send channels, allowing you to use effects like reverb and delay in parallel, just like in a professional DAW.
* **Per-Track Player & Recorder**: Load any audio file (like a backing track) directly into a track to be processed by its plugin chain. Record a track's post-FX output to quickly capture a processed vocal take or an idea.
* **Multi-Track Project System**:
    * **Record Project (RAW)**: Simultaneously record the raw, unprocessed input from both the Vocal and Music tracks.
    * **Manage Projects**: View, load, or delete your recorded projects.
    * **Synchronized Playback**: Load a project, and both raw tracks will play back in perfect sync.
* **Safety Lock System**: Prevent accidental changes during live performances by disabling core configuration controls.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notice for Waves Users

If you have a large collection of Waves plugins (e.g., Waves Ultimate), the initial plugin scan can take a significant amount of time. **This is normal!** Please do not close the application during the scan.

* **Estimated Scan Time:**
    * Small plugin set: A few seconds to 2 minutes.
    * Large plugin set (Waves Ultimate): Up to 10-15 minutes.

‚úÖ The scan only runs once. After completion, idolLiveAudio saves the results to a local file for much faster startups in the future.

## üéß Recommended Audio Setup

For the best experience, a dedicated external sound card with low-latency ASIO drivers is highly recommended.

**If you do not have a professional sound card, we strongly suggest installing these free tools:**

* [**VB-Cable**](https://vb-audio.com/Cable/) ‚Äì Virtual audio cable.
* [**ASIO4ALL**](https://www.asio4all.org/) ‚Äì Universal ASIO driver for low-latency audio.
* [**Voicemeeter Banana**](https://vb-audio.com/Voicemeeter/banana.htm) ‚Äì Virtual audio mixer and routing software.
